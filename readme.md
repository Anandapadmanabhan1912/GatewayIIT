## About the Project

Preparing for GATE often involves practicing from past year papers, but manually browsing and extracting questions is time-consuming. **GatewayIIT** automates this process:

- It scrapes GATE question papers hosted as PDF files from the official website.
- It extracts individual question images and parses the answer keys from the PDFâ€™s end sections.
- It organizes these into a structured quiz format, handling:
  - **MCQ** (Multiple Choice Questions)
  - **MSQ** (Multiple Select Questions)
  - **NAT** (Numerical Answer Type questions)
- After quiz completion, users receive a **detailed analysis** of their responses, enabling targeted revision and practice.
